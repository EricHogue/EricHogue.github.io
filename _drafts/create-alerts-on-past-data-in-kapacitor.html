<p>When creating some alerts in Kapacitor, comparing data to previous period can be hard. The tool to build alerts is great. But when I had no luck creating alerts for changes relative to a previous period of time. The rules will not look at back data. So if I wanted to compare a day to the previous day, I had to wait for the tool alert to gather data for a day, even if I already have enough data in InfluxDB. This does not work well if you want to compare a month to the previous one. Waiting a month for the first alert is too long. And if you restart the services, you have to start over collecting data.</p>
<p>I also wanted to have rules that will compare the current data to the average from a previous period. Compare how many pages in the last 24 hours compare to the average for the previous week. I could not do that with the Alert Rule Builder.</p>
