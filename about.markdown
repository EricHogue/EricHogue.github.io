  I am a web developer from Montreal, Quebec, Canada. I write about web development 
  and security. 

  I've been programing for 20 years. I started developing desktop applications in 
  Delphi, C# and C++. Then I moved to web, mostly in PHP and now Node. 

  I always liked security, with the perspective of writting secure code. But lately
  I've started learning how to hack, and I realy enjoy it.
