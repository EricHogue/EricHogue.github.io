A co-worker recently asked me how I stay current with new development in the PHP world. I started writing a document for him, then I though it might be a good idea to put this in a blog post. So here are a few of the resources I use. Most of them are about PHP, because that is what I was asked about, but I think it's important to look other areas also. So I will throw in a few links that are not strictly about PHP.

I use Google Reader to subscribe to a lot of blogs, probably too many. I also use twitter to find out what's happening. I follow people who are very active in the PHP, agile and software craftsmanship communities. When I see something interesting, I add it to [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/ "Instapaper"), so I can read it when I have time.

## Aggregators

Aggregators are great, by following a few, you can quickly get a good view of the community.

The main one for PHP is without any doubt PHPDeveloper. This aggregator is maintained by [Chris Cornutt](https://twitter.com/enygma "Chris Cornutt"). You can check the [website](http://www.phpdeveloper.org/ "PHPDeveloper") or the [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/phpdeveloper "PHPDeveloper on Twitter"), but don't miss this one. Everyday, you will get links to 4 or 5 of the best articles published in the PHP world. You will also get weekly reminder of the best posts of the week and of what was popular a year ago.

Here's a few other aggregator:

- [Zend Developer Zone](http://devzone.zend.com "Zend Developer Zone")
- [DZone Web Builder Zone](http://css.dzone.com/ "DZone Web Builder Zone")
- [PHP Quick Fix](https://twitter.com/phpquickfix "PHP Quick Fix")

## User Groups

I attempt a few user groups here in Montreal. I go to [PHP Québec](http://www.phpquebec.org/ "PHP Québec") every months and to [JS-Montreal](http://js-montreal.org/ "JS-Montreal"), [Montreal.rb](http://www.montrealonrails.com/ "Montreal.rb") and [OWASP Montreal](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Montreal "OWASP Montreal") every time I can. You probably have some user groups in you region. Check them out. They are great for learning and making contacts with other developers.

## Conferences

Conferences are more expensive, but they are really worth it. Here in Montreal, we have [ConFoo](http://confoo.ca/ "ConFoo") that is amazing. There is also [Agile Tour](http://at2012.agiletour.org/en/montreal.html "Agile Tour") that is coming in November. This year, I will also be at the first edition of [True North PHP](http://truenorthphp.ca/ "True North PHP") in Toronto.

Conferences are a good way to be introduce to many technologies. You get back home with lots of new ideas. And a lot of things to research.

## PHP Mentoring

[PHP Mentoring](http://phpmentoring.org/ "PHP Mentoring") is a new project that connects mentors with apprentices. I joined the program as soon as I heard about it and I'm very happy I did. I found two apprentices and a mentor in a few days. This is a great way to improve and learn a lot.

If you haven't looked at it, I suggest you go read the [guidelines and rules](http://phpmentoring.org/guidelines.html "PHP Mentoring Guidelines and Rules") and put your name on the [signup page](https://github.com/phpmentoring/phpmentoring.github.com/wiki/Mentors-and-Apprentices "PHP Mentoring Mentors and Apprentices") on GitHub. It does not matter if you do it as a mentor, an apprentice or both. I'm sure it will help you a lot.

When your name is there, look for someone who matches what you are looking for in the names already there and contact him. I see a lot of names there, and not enough matches.

Those are a few of the resources I check to stay current. There are a lot more in my feed reader and in the list of people I follow on Twitter. But I think those are the most informative when it comes to PHP development.

If you think I missed some good ones, please leave a comment. I'm always happy to find more sources of great content.
