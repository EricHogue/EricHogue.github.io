In the next few months, I will be a 2 conferences.

## True North PHP

[True North PHP](http://truenorthphp.ca/ "True North PHP") is a new conference that will be held in the Toronto area. It will be on November 2nd and 3rd. I'm very excited as I was chosen to speak. I will give an introduction to Continuous Integration. If you're curious about CI, come see me.

They managed to get an amazing line up of [speakers](http://truenorthphp.ca/speakers.php "True North PHP Speakers"). And at $200, [the tickets](http://truenorthphp.ca/tickets.php "Buy True North PHP Tickets") are really affordable.

## Confoo

[Confoo](http://confoo.ca "Confoo") will have its fourth edition from February 27 to March 1st of 2013. Confoo is always great and the next edition promise to be as good as the previous ones. I will not speak there, but I will attend it.

If you're in the Montreal region, [buy your ticket](http://confoo.ca/en/register "Buy Confoo tickets"), you won't regret it.
